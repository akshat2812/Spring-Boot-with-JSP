# Spring-Boot-with-JSP
I have added all the related the files i could manage.I have used Spring Boot with JSP and JDBC connection using MVC pattern. But after the crash it just wouldn't work the same way. I have uploaded the screenshots of the database creation.I couldnt get to the three reports.

I managed to work on the dependencies that were missing and the database is working again.

use /register in the web address to get to the page.
